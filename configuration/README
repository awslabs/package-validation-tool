This directory contains configuration files that help in the following two
stages of `suggest-remote-package-archives` CLI command:

- `transformations_{common,<distro>}.json` -- patterns to perform
  transformations of original local archives + Source stanzas of the package
  SRPM. Pattern example: regex clues to extract nested archives. Contents of
  this configuration file must be kept in sync with
  `package/suggesting/transformation_methods.py`.

- `suggestions_{common,<distro>}.json` -- patterns to suggest URLs of remote
  archives and corresponding Source stanzas in the package SRPM. Pattern
  example: list of URLs of well-known repositories that host archives of many
  software projects. Contents of this configuration file must be kept in sync
  with `package/suggesting/suggestion_methods.py`.

Patterns for the same transformation can be split across several files with a
naming convention `transformations_*.json`. Our code will concatenate all
patterns from all configuration files for the same transformation. Same logic
applies to suggestion patterns. This split helps to maintain distro-specific
patterns.
